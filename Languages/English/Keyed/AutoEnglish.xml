	<TD.SettingExtendRange>Increase max range for partially filled transport pods</TD.SettingExtendRange>
	<TD.SettingEmptyPercent>How much fuel does an empty pod require</TD.SettingEmptyPercent>
	<TD.FuelSettingsDesc>This mod makes unoccupied transport pods use less fuel. 
Each kg in the pod means more fuel is needed, and if the pod is full this mod makes no difference.

This also means the base game's maximum range might not use all the fuel.
So you can either keep that max range or let Fuel Economy extend the range for partially filled pods.</TD.FuelSettingsDesc>
	<TD.EmptyPercentDesc>This also affects the max range if enabled above.
100% would just be vanilla.
0% would mean weightless pods and insane range. Fuel cost would depend solely on contents.
50% would means the pod weighs 150kg and can hold another 150kg inside. A 50% fuel cost to launch, plus more fuel per passenger.</TD.EmptyPercentDesc>
